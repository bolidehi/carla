## system setting
Since the system uses too many sockets (or files), the user have to increase the maximum file limit as follows:

1. Add the following line to ```/etc/systemd/user.conf``` and ```/etc/systemd/system.conf```.
```
DefaultLimitNOFILE=65535
```
2. Add the following lines to ```/etc/security/limits.conf```
```
{your user name} hard nofile 65535
{your user name} soft nofile 65535
```
